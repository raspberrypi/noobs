.PP
.B con2fbmap
is a system utility to show or change the mapping of the consoles  to the
frame buffer device. The frame buffer device provides a simple and unique
interface to access different kinds of graphic displays.
.PP
Frame buffer devices are accessed via special device nodes located in the
/dev directory. The naming scheme for these nodes is always
.IR \fBfb < n >,
where
.I n
is the number of the used frame buffer device.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The first option must be there, and identify the console on which to work.
If the second option is not set, con2fbmap shows the current mapping of
identified console. If the second argument is given (as a number) con2fbmap
maps the identified console to said framebuffer device.
