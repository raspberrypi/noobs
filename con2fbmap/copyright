The source files refer to `the file COPYING in the main directory of the Linux
distribution', so that must be the GNU General Public License Version 2.

--------------- Clarification ----------------------------------------

On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
Public License can be found in '/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

--------------- Con2fbmap --------------------------------------------

Con2fbmap had no specific copyright, therefore I assume it falls under 
fbset's GPLv2 copyright and is attributed as such to Sven Luther.
